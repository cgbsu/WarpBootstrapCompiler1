# No Kill Do No Harm License

## 1. Preamble

Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the
consequences for our society and planet.

As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our
infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we
choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.

We envisage a world free from killing, injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our
planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that
hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature,
and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all
society.

We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that
vision further from reach.

To note: while we wish to retain human rights and want to see them contribute the outlined vison, there is an exception provided against [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](./documents/UDHR.md) and the [Convention on the Rights of the Child](./documents/CRC.md), because some interpretations may allow for or mandate the protection of euthanasia and or abortion which are intentionally prevented by this license. This is meant to be limited in scope and is not intended as a condemnation of human rights, but:
 * Prevents "Pro Life" organizations or individuals from being unable to use the Work
 * Prevents developers from inadvernantly cooperating in actions they may be ethically opposed too through the use of their work
 * Takes a position on how human rights should be interpreted (which does not have to be shared by organizations or individuals utilizing or redistributing this work)
 * Takes a position on human rights when they allow people to terminate Human Life or kill
